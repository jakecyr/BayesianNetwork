# Bayesian Network

A simple Bayesian network based on Baye's rule and the conditional independence assumption.

To run you must have Node.js installed on your computer (you can also run the JS from the bayesian_network.js file in a browser if you
replace the "module.exports." with "var ").

1. Download or clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the code directory using your terminal application and execute the following command `node app.js`.
